# Comparative Permic database

This database accompanies the paper *On the questions in developing computational infrastructure for Komi-Permyak* by Rueter, Partanen & Ponomareva. The goal of that study was investigate the most central differences that must be accounted for when adapting Komi-Zyrian morphological analyser to work on Komi-Permyak. The features discussed in the paper are collected here into a database that can be extended later.

Please see the [website](https://langdoc.github.io/comparative-permic-database) for more information.

The dataset itself is shared under CC-0, in order to allow as unproblematic reuse as possible.
